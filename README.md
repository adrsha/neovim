# Welcome to my Neovim configuration.

Its fully written in lua. And is powered by lazy.nvim package manager. So its got decent statup time. And most importantly, every easy to understand configuration. No custom stuff, yet its faily fast. 


## Plugins
Some of the interesting plugins used are:
* betterescape
* dashboard-nvim         
* nvim-lastplace
* revj    
* iconpicker                
* ssr
* indent-blankline  
* lualine    
* treesitter
* neoscroll 
You can see then entirety of the plugins in ``nvim/lua/plugins/``.

I'd say it gets a decent marks on the looks department too.
